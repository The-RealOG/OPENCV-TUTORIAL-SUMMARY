# ðŸ§  OpenCV with Python: My Computer Vision Journey

Welcome to my OpenCV journey! This repository documents everything I've been learning and building using **OpenCV + Python** â€” from basic image manipulation to more advanced computer vision techniques.

## ðŸš€ What You'll Find Here

This repo contains:
- âœ… Python scripts on core OpenCV concepts
- âœ… Hands-on experiments with real images and videos
- âœ… Notes, comments, and personal reflections as I explore

Each file builds on the previous, making it beginner-friendly but progressively more advanced.

## Enjoy
